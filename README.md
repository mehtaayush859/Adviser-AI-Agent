Advisor AI Agent
Welcome to the Advisor AI Agent repository!

This project was created during the Microsoft OpenAI Hackathon where I collaborated on building an AI agent focused on insurance advisory.
The Advisor AI Agent leverages machine learning models trained on real-world insurance datasets to provide personalized insurance cost estimates based on user inputs such as:

As in Prompt: Example: I want to visit Maldives which my family which includes 4 people. What will be the costing for insurance, destinations, and some other stuff like places to visit etc.

Location
Vacation Destinations
Age
Existing medical conditions or diseases
Other risk factors

Features
🧠 AI-Driven Insurance Advisor: Uses a trained model to estimate average insurance costs and travel locations and vacations destinations.

🗺️ Location-Based Estimates: Adjusts costs based on the user's location.

👤 Personalized Predictions: Tailors insurance recommendations based on individual health profiles.

📊 Dataset Collaboration: Built using curated datasets for insurance claims and cost analysis.

🤝 Hackathon Collaboration: Project was forked, enhanced, and contributed as part of a team at the Microsoft OpenAI Hackathon.
